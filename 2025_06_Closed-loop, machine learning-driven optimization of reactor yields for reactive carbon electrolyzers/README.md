# Closed-loop, Machine Learning-Driven Optimization of Reactor Yields for Reactive Carbon Electrolyzers

This repository contains code and data supporting the manuscript titled **"Closed-loop, Machine Learning-Driven Optimization of Reactor Yields for Reactive Carbon Electrolyzers."**  
This work features a closed-loop platform for maximizing the reactor yield of a reactive carbon electrolyzer through automation and machine learning.

## Repository Structure

The repository includes the following folders and dataset:

- **Data_analysis_code/**  
   Contains scripts and notebooks used to analyze experimental results and generate all figures and visualizations included in the manuscript. This includes data processing, plotting, and formatting of output for publication-quality figures.

- **Optimization_code/**  
   Includes optimization routines, machine learning models, and supporting functions to perform reactor yield optimization based on input parameters.

- **Simulation_code/**  
   Contains code for simulating optimization campaigns of reactor systems. This includes generation of performance benchmarking data for various sampling strategies such as q-noisy expected improvement (qNEI), q-expected improvement (qEI), and q-upper confidence bound (qUCB), as well as random sampling.  


- **Dataset_Bicarbonate_Optimization.xlsx**  
   Excel spreadsheet containing all experimental data (manipulated and responsing variables), and metadata for the bicarbonate reactor yield optimization project.
