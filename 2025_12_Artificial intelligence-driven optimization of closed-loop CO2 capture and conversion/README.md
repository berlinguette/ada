# Artificial intelligence-driven optimization of closed-loop CO2 capture and conversion

This repository contains code and data supporting the manuscript titled **"Artificial intelligence-driven optimization of closed-loop CO2 capture and conversion."**  
This work shows that AI-optimized reactive carbon capture can simultaneously absorb and electrochemically upgrade CO₂ in a liquid sorbent without heat or vacuum, increasing capture efficiency from 30% to 83% and FECO from 30% to 42%, and enabling CO production at less than $1 per kilogram, among the lowest costs for converting air into fuel.

## Repository Structure

The repository includes the following folders and dataset:

- **optimization_code/**  
   Includes optimization routines, machine learning models, and supporting functions to perform reactive carbon capture optimization based on input parameters.

- **experiment_data.csv**  
   CSV file containing all experimental data (manipulated and responsing variables), and metadata for this multi-objective optimization project.
